// To automate these tests, implement them using a framework like Cypress:
/*
describe('What\'s Hitting E2E Tests', () => {

    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000');
  });

    // Check if games are loaded
    cy.get('.game-card').should('have.length.at.least', 10);
    
    // Check if game images are displayed
    cy.get('.game-image').should('be.visible');
    
    // Check if game titles are displayed
    cy.get('.game-title').should('be.visible');
